The Visible Net is a blogging outlet for the “Academic Contingent” of mechanistic interpretability machine intelligence researchers, as well as an incubation space for the proposed National Deep Inference Facility. It is a shared blogging space for students, collaborators, and others working on mechanistic interpretability.

Contact us at [info@thevisible.net](mailto:info@thevisible.net), or reach out to [David](mailto:davidbau@northeastern.edu) directly.

This project was started by [David Bau](https://baulab.info/), an assistant professor at Northeastern University.  David's lab focuses on understanding the interpretable mechanisms that emerge from large-scale machine learning.

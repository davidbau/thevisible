The Visible Net is a blogging outlet for the “Academic Contingent” of mechanistic interpretability machine intelligence researchers, as well as an incubation space for the proposed National Deep Inference Facility. It is a shared blogging space for students, collaborators, and others working on mechanistic interpretability.

This project was started by [David Bau](https://baulab.info/), an assistant professor at Northeastern University.  David's lab focuses on understanding the interpretable mechanisms that emerge from large-scale machine learning.

The [horizontal lightbulb](/images/side_bulb_square.jpg) depiction represents the emergence of ideas in a transparent setting where the internal mechanisms can all be inspected.  The bulb is alight without an apparent energy source, suggesting the emergence of cognitive structure from data without explicit design.

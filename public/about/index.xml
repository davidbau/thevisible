      <description>The Visible Net is a blogging outlet for the “Academic Contingent” of mechanistic interpretability machine intelligence researchers, as well as an incubation space for the proposed National Deep Inference Facility. It is a shared blogging space for students, collaborators, and others working on mechanistic interpretability.
Contact us at info@thevisible.net, or reach out to David directly.
This project was started by David Bau, an assistant professor at Northeastern University. David&amp;rsquo;s lab focuses on understanding the interpretable mechanisms that emerge from large-scale machine learning.</description>

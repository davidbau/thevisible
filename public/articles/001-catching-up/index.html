    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Today I got an email from my good college friend David Maymudes.  David got his math degree from Harvard few years ahead of me, and he I have both worked at Microsoft and Google at overlapping times. He is still at Google now.  We have both witnessed and helped drive major cycles of platform innovation in the industry in the past, and David is well aware of the important pieces of work that go into building a new technology ecosystem.  From inside Google today, he is a direct witness to the transformation of that company as the profound new approaches to artificial intelligence become a corporate priority.  It is obvious that something major is afoot: a new ecosystem is being created.  Although David does not directly work on large-scale machine learning, it touches on his work. Because it is touching everybody.</p>
<p>Yet David is not a deep learning specialist.  He is an outsider to our field, so he wrote me to ask some clarifying questions about some specific technical ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf">RLHF</a> all about?</li>
<li>Do people do it by literally train the whole thing as a single black box, or are there many boxes?</li>
<li>What about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUjc1WuyPT8">Eliezer Yudowsky&rsquo;s</a> AI Safety discussions?</li>
<li>And what about this new <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins">component architecture in chatGPT</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>So much to catch up on.  Here is my response to David&rsquo;s specific questions.  It is a bit of a crash-course in modern large language modeling.  A lot hs been happening in the lat few years.</p>
<h1 id="yes-it-is-a-monolith">Yes, it is a monolith.</h1>
<p>Here are some details of, physicallly, what the systems are.</p>
<p>When we train a base autoregressive (next-word-prediction) transformer model like GPT, we are making a function that takes a sequence of words as input, and that will produce the predicted next word as output. To be absolutely precise, as output, it will actually produce a ranking of all the possible next words and their correct probability weights.</p>
<p>Physically this function is implemented using arithmetic.  We turn each word-fragment in the input into vector of a few thousand numbers using a big lookup table, so that the whole sequence of input words will be many thousands of numbers.  Then we execute a single crazy big high-dimensional calculation that applies a few rounds of simple arithmetic to all these numers in a few dozen parallel steps, with each step transforming each array of many thousands of numbers to another array of just as many numbers.</p>
<p>At each step, every single number could in principle depend on every number of the previous step, but the exact dependencies are determined by an architecture that does lookups in big parameter tables, an the size of those tables puts a ceiling on the complexity that can be encoded.  For example GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters.  The size of GPT-4 is unknown but some believe it to be about a trillion parameters.  You can think of these sizes as &ldquo;the size of the interpreter that is processing the text.&rdquo; After the dozens of rounds of calculation, the final output vector is read off the last layer of the output, and that vector is compared to a final ouput lookup table (that contains one vector for each possible output word-fragment) that is used to determine the possible next words.</p>
<p>This word-prediction-as-vector-calculation idea is a very simple framework, one that was developed in the 1990s by folks like <a href="https://papers.baulab.info/Elman-1990.pdf">Jeff Ellman</a> and <a href="https://papers.baulab.info/also/Jordan-1986.pdf">Michael Jordan</a> and <a href="https://papers.baulab.info/Bengio-2003.pdf">Yoshua Bengio</a> and <a href="https://papers.baulab.info/Hochreiter-1997.pdf">Sepp Hochreiter</a>. But what&rsquo;s new in recent years is that we have found a good way to cleverly constrain the computations to impose some structure that reduce the complexity of the computation and improve parallelism in a very effective way. The structures that we impose today are &ldquo;attention heads&rdquo; (<a href="https://papers.baulab.info/Bahdanau-2015.pdf">a 2015 idea from Dzmitry Bahdanau</a>) and &ldquo;multilayer perceptrons&rdquo; (<a href="https://papers.baulab.info/Rosenblatt-1962.pdf">credit Rosenblatt from the 1960&rsquo;s I guess</a>) and &ldquo;residual streams&rdquo; (<a href="https://papers.baulab.info/He-2015.pdf">due to Kaiming He in 2015</a>) and the way the pieces are put together is done is what people call the &ldquo;transformer architecture&rdquo; (<a href="https://papers.baulab.info/Vaswani-2017.pdf">devised by Ashish Vaswani from Google in 2017</a>).  All the gory details of transformers are explained beautifully by <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/">Jay Alammmar in his illustrated transformer series</a>.</p>
<p>Transformers can be thought of as encouraging sparse data-associative wiring diagrams within all the calculations, and they have proven very effective at learning computational patterns that people might call intelligent.  But for the most part, the computational paths that are learned within the transformer architecture form a crazy amalgamation of internal circuits that is opaque to us. We train it as a monolith, to solve the very simple <em>pretext task</em> of predicting the probabilities of the possible next words as accurately as possible. The internal computational structure that emerges is very surprising, and that is the subject of the study of mechanistic interpretability.  And that is what we will focus on in this blog.</p>
<h1 id="prompt-engineering-and-in-context-learning">Prompt engineering and in-context learning.</h1>
<p>The idea that so many capabilities could be learned from this task is very surprising and was not obvious to experts.  (Maybe Jeff Ellman has the vision, but if people had really known, they might have pushed harder on the idea in the 1990s!)  Credit for some intuition goes to Alec Radford at OpenAI who <a href="https://papers.baulab.info/Radford-2018.pdf">pushed hard on scaling up autoregregressive transformers in the initial GPT work in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>In a series of increasing investments in larger GPT models trained with more parameters on more text, Radford and his collaborators found that this simple architecture was a remarkable chameleon. For example it very quickly guesses the context, and if it thinks it is in the middle of a book of poems it will use a strategy that leads it to generate more poetry. But it sees context that looks like a blog, it will generate blog-like text.  Same for a spreadsheet.  Or a screenplay, a fortran program, a reddit thread, a parallel multilingual text, the answer key for a test, the output of a computer script, a dialogue between two people, a diary describing the internal ruminations of a person, etc etc.  You get the idea - it turns out that very large language models are very good at writing text in very different styles.  While this extreme context-sensitivity seems like an oddball phenomenon, it may be a linchpin that leads to reasonable models of cognition; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01681">Jacob Andreas has written convincingly about this viewpoint</a>.</p>
<p>The observation of context-sensitivity has led to a flood of <em>prompt engineering</em> in recent years that demonstrate all the tricks you can do by setting up some clever input context for the model (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13586">see this prompting survey from Pengfei Liu</a>). For example, if you set up the input text to look like a standardized test, you can see how well the model can complete the answer key, and what is remarkable is that the large models contain real-world knowledge of facts and relationships, or even the ability to solve some math problems (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01066">read Petroni 2019</a>).  With different prompts, it is stunning to see the model do things like translate between French and English when you prompt it as if it is working on parallel text.  Or predict the output of a computer program given the code.  Or write out step-by-step reasoning for some complex problem.  Or even follow instructions, e.g. &ldquo;write me a poem,&rdquo; and then it predicts that the best next words are a poem.</p>
<p>One of the most effective ways to create a prompt is called &ldquo;in-context learning&rdquo; (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00234">survey here</a>) where you give a handful of fully-worked examples the way that you&rsquo;d like to see them done (starting with the problem and followed by the answer), and then you put as the last example the problem, and ask the model to make its prediction.  This works even better if you do it in a way that writes out the work explicitly; this is called &ldquo;chain of thought&rdquo; prompting (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903">observed by Jason Wei</a>).</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s more convenient for people when a model is able to solve a problem &ldquo;zero shot,&rdquo; i.e., with no worked examples shown at all.  Some consensus is now forming that the most useful mode for these models is the &ldquo;instruction-following&rdquo; mode, where instead of requiring a few examples, you give it an explicit instruction, like &ldquo;write me a poem&rdquo;, and then it follows with a poem.  Base pretrained GPT can do that, to some extent, but it is often unsure about whether it should actually follow the instructions or not.  Perhaps after you give it an instruction, you might want some other text, such as a list of other possible different instructions.</p>
<h1 id="instruction-fine-tuning-and-ai-safety">Instruction fine-tuning and AI Safety.</h1>
<p>One of the main techniques in modern machine learning is <em>transfer learning</em> (studied by many e.g., <a href="https://papers.baulab.info/Yosinksi-2014.pdf">Yosinksi 2014</a>), where you begin with some great capabilities in a pretrained model, then you continue to train it, fine-tuning the parameters to better fit data drawn from the specific context where you want to apply it.  The goal ist to get the capabilities focused on the problem you care about.  For example, maybe the original GPT model is able to do things that appear in open text that are a little less interesting, such as write fallacious, fractured, or even fanatical text, since there is a lot of such text in real-world training data.  We might want to fine-tune the model by training it to mimic an honest, humanlike, and humane style that we wish to se.</p>
<p>So, based in the idea that &ldquo;instruction following&rdquo; is the most useful kind of text, teams at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155">OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01652.pdf">Google</a> and <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html">Stanford</a> (and others) have collected together many thousands of examples of instruction-following dialogues which have all the attributes that you might want. For example, after the input starts with a request that contains an instruction, the model should predict a response that gives a direct answer to the instruction that follows the instruction in a way that is correct, well-reasoned, well-written, and even ethical.</p>
<p>How is such fine-tuning done?  OpenAI happens to fine-tune GPT on instruction-following using a combination of direct word-prediction training and reinforcement learning based on a learned policy model - that is why it is &ldquo;RLHF&rdquo;.  But the use of reinforcement learning is an implementation detail that not everybody uses, and it is reasonable to simply tune the model to predict words in the new data set. The basic idea is to adjust the model so that, from the start, it begins with the assumption it is working in the particular instruction-following linguistic context that we want it to be in.</p>
<p>How useful and powerful that linguistic context is depends on three things: (1) the pretraining data (all the world&rsquo;s text); (2) the pretraining architecture (what computations the transformer was able to learn from the world&rsquo;s text); and (3) the specific form of the instruction feedback fine-tuning (in particular the instruction-tuning example data).</p>
<p>For example, if you instruct a model by fine-tuning it on text written on a 3rd grade level, then you will expect to get a model that produces 3rd grade output. But if you fine-tune it on an amazing range of difficult and useful instruction-following tasks, then you can hope for it to mimic that ability to solve difficult problems.  You can look at examples of instruction-following data within the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/tatsu-lab/alpaca">Stanford Alpaca dataset, here on huggingface</a>.</p>
<p>This ability to fine-tune a model to follow our explicit instructions also touches on concerns that people like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUjc1WuyPT8">Eliezer Yudowsky</a> have long had that large-scale machine learning may end up producing systems that end up being destructive to humanity.  Instrutions seem to give us a way to make models a little safer. The idea is, we can train models to follow our instructions, and also in their answers, to follow societal norms and even ethical constraints, by giving lots of examples.  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073">Anthropic</a> in particular has been thinking about how to encode ethical reasoning into model fine-tuning data.</p>
<p>Why this might work at all is itself wonderous (and again the subject of study in this blog).  If we are truly interested in AI safety, it would seem to demand a deeper understanding of what is happening under the hood.  But training models to follow our instructions by-example seems to work.  So that is the modern program.</p>
<h1 id="retrieval-methods-tool-use-and-secrecy">Retrieval methods, tool use, and secrecy.</h1>
<p>It is obvious that there is a fourth thing you might want the model to be able to depend on, which is tools and resources in the real world.</p>
<p>So you can make this fourth thing part of the fine-tuning data.  For example, you could instruct the model, so that, as part of answering, when it would be approprate to do a Google search for X, it should output a special token <code>[invoke googlesearch X]</code>, and then it should expect to see further input that includes all the top Google search results.  Or when it would be appropriate to see the contents of a web page at url U, it should say <code>[invoke webget U]</code> and it would be able to see the contents of the web page on the input. Of course an ordinary GPT model might have no idea when it should be doing web searches and so on, but perhaps if we give it a few examples, or better yet we you include many thousand fully-worked interactions of this form, where we pantomime the interaction with the open web within an instruction-fine-tuning data set, then it will start to exploit this new form of interaction.</p>
<p>We could bake such interactions into the transformer during pre-training; these are called &ldquo;retrieval based architectures,&rdquo; (e.g., see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04426">RETRO, Sebastian Borgeaud 2021</a>), and they work.  They tend to create models that do not waste all their parameters memorizing the world&rsquo;s knowledge, but instead they will make requests to see different pieces of text when making predictions. But you could also add such interactions at fine-tuning time, after pretraining on ordinary word prediction.  Because fine-tuning is fast and much more amenable to quick experimentation and engineering than training from scratch, that is probably what I would expect to see in practice.  What you would need is a data set of thousands of worked examples of tool use.</p>
<p>OpenAI has not revealed the internal architecture or training methods used to create ChatGPT, but three days ago they released a new plugin architecture that suggests that tool-use has been a major part of their work on ChatGPT.  You can see some examples of their plug-in architecture here.</p>
<p><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/examples">https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/examples</a>.</p>
<p>OpenAI has not disclosed how they created this plugin architecture, but I imagine that what they have done is to create a general-purpose template that they have included in their instruction-following fine-tuning procedure where the model learns to recognize some form of <code>[invoke tool with input X]</code> for making a request to an external tool and seeing the response.  They have probably created a large dataset of such tool use, maybe by instrumenting web browsers to watch people using lots of tools online including search engines, calendars, online stores, etc.  Or maybe by having a team of people making REST API calls for successful interactions and encoding these as examples &ldquo;instruction following&rdquo; scripts.</p>
<p>So, in this world, how does the system decide which one is relevant to use?</p>
<p>OpenAI has not disclosed how they are training ChatGPT to make this choice, but this could be solved in a number of ways, for example, in their instruction-fine-tuning examples, they could provide a piece of text to the input of GPT that lists all the descriptions of tools, and then after that context, they could have examples of choosing the right tool from the list at an appropriate moment during conversation, while being careful to demosntragte in the training data that tools that is not on the listed input should never be used.  After seeing a few thousand of such worked examples during fine-tuning, I would expect it to be able to mimic generic tool use pretty well.</p>
<p>We are in an interesting but concerning new era now, where the key decision-making of the algorithm is doubly opaque.  First, the way that OpenAI has hooked together their system is opaque to us, since it is a proprietary trade secret.  That is similar to how Google&rsquo;s search ranking is opaque to outsiders, since Google will not reveal its very clever internal methods for deciding between websites.</p>
<p>But now, there is a second, profound issue, that should drive our real concern.  Unlike the case of Google (you and I both are aware of Google&rsquo;s internal query debugging facilities), when working with a massive model like GPT-3 or GPT-4, the decision-making of the model is opauqe even to OpenAI themselves.  When the model chooses one tool over another, the engineers may not have any insight as to &ldquo;why,&rdquo; beyond the billions of tangled arithmetic operations that led to the prediction of a token.</p>
<p>We will train our models and guide our models using billions of pretraining examples, cleverly chosen architectures, and thousands of fine-tuning examples.  But then the actual algorithm that it applies is the result of a massive and opaque optimization.</p>
<p>What are these systems actually learning?</p>
<p>That is the most urgent problem facing computer science, and maybe all of science, today.</p>
<p>It is important to ask the question transparently and openly, and not as a trade secret.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I left Google to work on this.</p>
